                        <p>If you don’t feed your house plants, they won’t thrive. Start feeding regularly, around three
                            months
                            after you’ve planted them, as the nutrients present in the compost start to deplete after
                            this time.
                            Use a liquid feed diluted in water, following the instructions on the bottle. Most
                            houseplants don’t
                            need feeding more than once every one to three months, between March and September</p>
